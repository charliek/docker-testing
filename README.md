Docker Testing
==============

This is a very simple repo so I can have a lightweight docker container for testing.

This project can be found in the docker index at `charliek/docker-testing`. The
following tags are there as well. These containers/tags are useful for deployment
testing.

* green == 0.1.0 == (green background)
* red == 0.2.0 == (red background)
* latest (untaged, light blue background)
